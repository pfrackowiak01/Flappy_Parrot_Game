###Simple Game Project in Unity created by Paweł Frąckowiak (2023)

#### A few words from the author:

This is my first game created in Unity. It is a fangame inspired by the popular game Flappy Bird. The assets and initial mechanics were made following a tutorial. I added additional features myself, such as a menu, collision detection, jumping animation and highscore saving. I also addressed potential inconsistencies and optimized the code.

## GOAL OF THE GAME

The goal of the game Flappy Parrot is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without colliding with them. The player needs to press spacebar or click left mouse button to make the bird flap its wings and ascend, while gravity pulls it down. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by successfully maneuvering the bird through the narrow gaps between the pipes. The game ends if the bird collides with any obstacle (pipes or screen borders).
